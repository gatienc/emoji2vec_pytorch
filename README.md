# emoji2vec with pytorch
PyTorch implementation of [emoji2vec: Learning Emoji Representations from their Description](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08359.pdf) by Ben Eisner, Tim Rocktäschel, Isabelle Augenstein, Matko Bošnjak, and Sebastian Riedel. Please check out the original tensorflow implementation [here](https://github.com/uclmr/emoji2vec).

## Note
This repo constitutes an exercise aiming to develop a better understanding of PyTorch and the methods described in the paper. The work presented here bases heavily on the original implementation. In fact one of the goals of this exercise was to translate the neural part of the original repo to PyTorch while maintaining its higher level functionality. Consequently a significant proportion of the code as well as the documentation is the work of the original authors and it is presented here with no intention to taking credit for it.
